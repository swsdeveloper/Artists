UITableView Program for finding artists by Art Movement

This is a project I created to help learn Swift. It displays a table of color-coded Art Movements (eg: Impressionist, Abstract). When one of the items is tapped, another table is displayed showing some artists (listed using the color of the related Art Movement) known for that style of painting. When an artist is tapped, a web view is brought up using wikiart.org
